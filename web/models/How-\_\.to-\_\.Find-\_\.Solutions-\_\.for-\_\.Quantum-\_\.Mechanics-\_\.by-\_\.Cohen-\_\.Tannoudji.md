# How to Find Solutions for Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji
 
Quantum Mechanics by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji and his colleagues Bernard Diu and Franck LaloÃ« is a classic textbook that introduces the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics such as waves, particles and probability before explaining the postulates of quantum mechanics in detail. The textbook covers the classical scope of introductory quantum mechanics, namely simple two-level systems, the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the quantized angular momentum and particles in a central potential. The textbook also contains more than 350 worked examples and exercises that help students to test their understanding and apply their knowledge.

However, finding solutions for the exercises in Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji can be challenging, as the textbook does not provide any solutions manual or answer key. Fortunately, there are some online resources that can help students to find solutions for some of the exercises in the textbook. Here are some of them:
 
- **Numerade**: Numerade is an online platform that provides access to video solutions and explanations for thousands of textbooks, including Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji. Students can browse by chapter and section to find the solutions they need. Numerade also offers free trial and subscription plans for students who want to access more features and content.[^1^]
- **Chegg**: Chegg is another online platform that offers homework help, textbook solutions and expert answers for various subjects, including quantum physics. Students can search by ISBN or title to find the solutions manual for Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji. Chegg also requires a subscription fee to access the full solutions.[^3^]
- **Wiley**: Wiley is the publisher of Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji, and it offers some supplementary materials for instructors and students who use the textbook. Students can access some sample chapters, appendices and errata from the Wiley website. However, Wiley does not provide any solutions manual or answer key for the textbook.[^2^]

These are some of the online resources that can help students to find solutions for Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji. However, students should also remember that these resources are not substitutes for studying the textbook itself, and they should use them only as references or guides. Students should also check with their instructors or peers if they have any doubts or questions about the exercises in the textbook.
  
Quantum mechanics is one of the most fascinating and profound branches of physics, as it reveals the nature of matter and energy at the smallest scales. Quantum mechanics also has many applications in science and technology, such as lasers, superconductors, nanotechnology and quantum computing. However, quantum mechanics is also notoriously difficult and counterintuitive, as it challenges our common sense and classical intuition. Therefore, learning quantum mechanics requires a lot of patience, curiosity and practice.
 
One of the best ways to learn quantum mechanics is to use a good textbook that explains the concepts clearly and rigorously, and provides examples and exercises that illustrate the principles and methods of quantum mechanics. Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji is one of the most recommended textbooks for quantum mechanics, as it covers the basic and advanced topics in a comprehensive and pedagogical way. The textbook also has a unique style that combines chapters that introduce the main ideas and complements that provide more details and applications. The textbook also has a historical perspective that shows how quantum mechanics developed over time and how it relates to other fields of physics.
 
However, using a textbook alone is not enough to master quantum mechanics. Students also need to practice solving problems and exercises that test their understanding and skills. Solving problems also helps students to develop their intuition and creativity in quantum mechanics. However, finding solutions for the exercises in Quantum Mechanics by Cohen Tannoudji can be hard, as the textbook does not have any solutions manual or answer key. Therefore, students may need to use some online resources that can help them to find solutions for some of the exercises in the textbook. These online resources can be useful as references or guides, but they should not be used as substitutes for studying the textbook itself or for consulting with instructors or peers.
